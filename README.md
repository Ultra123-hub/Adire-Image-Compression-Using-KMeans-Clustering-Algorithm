# Adire-Image-Compression-Using-KMeans-Clustering-Algorithm
On this project, image compression was performed on Adire shirt, a cultural textile design in south-west Nigeria, Africa. This repository contains the code and environmental resources for the said project using the kmeans algorithm.

# About Kmeans Model


# Objectives
* Carry out preprocessing on the input image data to prepare it for modelling.
* Visualize the data points to better understand the colour clusters and swatches.
* Fitting the kmeans clustering algorithm on the data in order to attain an optimal clustering across the centroids.
* Optimizing the model and finding the optimal k values.
* Evaluating the model using major evaluation metrics like inertia and silhouette scores.


# Environmental Setup and Package Installation
KMeans is one of the most straightforward and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Its simplicity, efficiency and most importantly, versatility are what set it apart. Whether youâ€™re in for image compression, customer segmentation, genomics or anomaly detection, you see, KMeans is your guy.
