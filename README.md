# Adire-Image-Compression-Using-KMeans-Clustering-Algorithm
On this project, image compression was performed on Adire shirt, a cultural textile design in south-west Nigeria, Africa. This repository contains the code and environmental resources for the said project using the kmeans algorithm.

# About Kmeans Model
KMeans is one of the most straightforward and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Its simplicity, efficiency and most importantly, versatility are what set it apart. Whether youâ€™re in for image compression, customer segmentation, genomics or anomaly detection, you see, KMeans is your guy.


# Objectives
* Carry out preprocessing on the input image data to prepare it for modeling.
* Visualize the data points to better understand the colour clusters and swatches.
* Fitting the kmeans clustering algorithm on the data in order to attain an optimal clustering across the centroids.
* Optimizing the model and finding the optimal k values.
* Evaluating the model using major evaluation metrics like inertia and silhouette scores.


# Environmental Setup and Package Installation

# Preprocessing the Input Image Data
Conversion of the image data into a row-column data in RGB dimension. Processing revealed that the data has 1112320 x 3 dimension. However, due to our computing power, a sample of 700,00
was taken for the 3d plot.
